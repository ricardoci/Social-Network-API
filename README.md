# Social-Network-API
build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.


# description

```
- What was your motivation? I was motivated by the opportunity to create my own social api.
- Why did you build this project? The purpose of testing was to apply the skills that I acquired during the program.
- What problem does it solve? Creating an api with mongoose and mongo allow for a more dynamic and scalable social platform.
- What did you learn? One of the challenges I encounter was getting the reactions and thoughts to delete and post but I was able to get it working. Lack of time did'nt allow me to finish the update methods.
